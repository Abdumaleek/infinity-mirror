#   notes on Graph Auto-Encoders
- to enable GPU, use the `--nv` singularity flag
- remember to make sure that `gpu_id` is always set to a sensible value
    - e.g., don't have `gpu_id=3` if there is only one GPU on the system configured with CUDA
    - if there is only one GPU configured, set `gpu_id=0` wherever encountered

##  requirements
### conda
- `python 2.7`
    - version `?` of `Miniconda`
- `tensorflow-gpu â©¾ 1.0`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `networkx`
- `numpy`

##  required code modifications

##  training the model
- run `python train.py`
